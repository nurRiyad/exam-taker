# Technical Design

This is the detailed engineering reference: exact stack, project structure, local dev workflow, and production deployment. Product/architecture *decisions* and their rationale live in `docs/adr/*` — this doc explains how those decisions fit together operationally. Start with `docs/README.md` if you need the "why" behind any choice below.

## Stack Summary

| Layer | Choice | Decision record |
|---|---|---|
| Backend framework | Hono on Cloudflare Workers | ADR-0004 |
| Relational database | Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) | ADR-0004 |
| Query layer | Drizzle ORM (`drizzle-orm/d1`) | ADR-0059 |
| Migrations | `drizzle-kit generate` → SQL files → `wrangler d1 migrations apply` | ADR-0059, `.claude/skills/d1-schema` |
| Validation | Zod, with `drizzle-zod` deriving schemas from DB tables where shapes overlap | ADR-0059 |
| Cache / ephemeral data | Cloudflare KV (never source of truth for submissions/payments) | ADR-0004 |
| Auth | JWT as a bearer token (`Authorization: Bearer`, stored client-side in a non-httpOnly cookie), PBKDF2-SHA256 password hashing via Web Crypto | ADR-0054, ADR-0064 |
| Tenancy | One shared multi-tenant deployment, scoped by `tenant_id` | ADR-0052 |
| Frontend framework | Next.js (App Router) | ADR-0005 |
| Frontend hosting | Vercel (native Next.js build, no adapter) | ADR-0063 (supersedes ADR-0060) |
| API hosting | Cloudflare Worker | ADR-0060, ADR-0063 |
| Domain topology | Free default domains for now — `*.vercel.app` (frontend), `*.workers.dev` (API); no custom domain yet | ADR-0063 |
| CORS | API allow-lists the exact deployed frontend origin(s), allows `Authorization` header, no credentialed cookies | ADR-0064 |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions: `format`/`lint`/`typecheck`/`build`/`test` run as independent parallel jobs on every PR; on merge to `main`, API migrates+deploys via Wrangler, frontend deploys via Vercel's Git integration | ADR-0063 |
| Component system | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui | ADR-0061 |
| Design posture | Mobile-first everywhere, not just the exam page | ADR-0061, ADR-0002 |
| API type sharing | Hono RPC (`hono/client`), type-only import of the API's `AppType` — no generated client, no separate types package | ADR-0059 |
| Backend code layering | `apps/api` routes → controllers → services → repositories, one set per resource | ADR-0062 |
| PDF/print | `pdf-lib`-style direct generation, no headless browser | ADR-0057 |
| Monorepo tooling | pnpm workspaces (no Turborepo yet — two apps don't need it; add later if build times justify it) | this doc |
| Budget guardrail | Under 2,000 BDT/month during early validation | ADR-0051 |

```

Notes:

- `apps/api/src` is layered routes → controllers → services → repositories per resource (ADR-0062). Route handlers must stay inline one-line arrows in the chain (Hono RPC type inference for `hc<AppType>()` depends on it) and delegate immediately to a controller — the layering happens inside that delegation, not by breaking the chain. Only `auth` is fully layered so far; apply the same shape to each new resource in Steps 4+ rather than reverting to inline route logic.
- No `packages/shared` directory. API contract types flow through Hono's RPC client (`AppType`), and DB-shape validation flows through `drizzle-zod` — both eliminate the usual reason for a shared-types package. Add one later only if a real cross-cutting need shows up (for example, shared constants used by both apps that aren't API-shaped), not preemptively.
- Route groups in `apps/app/` — `(public)`, `(student)`, `(teacher)`, `(admin)` — map directly to the four roles in `docs/mvp-spec.md`; this is a Next.js App Router convention (parentheses = no effect on the URL path), used purely to keep each role's pages and layouts organized separately.

## Local Development

Prerequisites: Node `24.14.1` (pinned in `.nvmrc` — run `nvm use` in the repo root before anything else; this environment's shell does not auto-switch on `cd`), `pnpm` (via Corepack — `corepack enable` once per Node install), the Wrangler CLI. A Cloudflare account is only needed for `wrangler login` and remote operations — local dev (including local D1) works offline.

### First-time setup (new machine / new clone)

1. **Switch Node versions**: `nvm use` (reads `.nvmrc`). Re-run this every time you start a new shell in this repo — the shell does not auto-switch on `cd`.
2. **Install**: `pnpm install` at the repo root (installs both apps' dependencies through the workspace, and builds `better-sqlite3`'s native binary via `pnpm-workspace.yaml`'s `onlyBuiltDependencies` — needed by `db:studio`).
3. **Apply migrations locally**: `pnpm db:migrate:local` → runs `wrangler d1 migrations apply exam-taker-db --local`, which creates a local SQLite file simulating D1 under `apps/api/.wrangler/state/`. No real Cloudflare resource needed for this — do this once; it's a no-op on future runs once the file exists (skip straight to "Resuming" below after this).
4. **(Optional) Seed a local admin account**: `pnpm --filter api db:seed:admin` — idempotent, inserts one admin user (`localadmin` / `admin123456`) into the local D1 only if it doesn't already exist. Useful for exercising login/role-guarded routes without going through signup.
5. **Run everything**: in one terminal, `pnpm dev` at the root, which runs concurrently:
   - `apps/api`: `wrangler dev` on port 8787.
   - `apps/web`: `next dev` on port 3000 (Next.js auto-falls back to 3001+ if 3000 is already taken locally), with `next.config.ts` `rewrites()` forwarding `/api/*` → the API dev server.

   In a second terminal, `pnpm db:studio` (root alias for `pnpm --filter api db:studio`, i.e. `drizzle-kit studio`) opens a browser UI at `https://local.drizzle.studio` (talking to a local server on port 4983) against the same local D1 sqlite file `wrangler dev` uses — `apps/api/drizzle.config.ts` resolves that file's path itself (its name includes a wrangler-generated hash) and errors loudly if it ever finds more than one candidate file, instead of silently opening the wrong one.
6. Open the printed `apps/web` URL. The auth token travels as an `Authorization: Bearer` header attached by application code (ADR-0064), so it works the same whether the browser call is same-origin (dev, via the rewrite proxy) or cross-origin (prod, direct to `*.workers.dev`) — the rewrite proxy is kept for convenience but isn't load-bearing for auth. Server Components call the API's origin directly (`API_INTERNAL_URL`, defaults to `http://localhost:8787`), bypassing the rewrite entirely, reading the token from the request's cookies to attach the header themselves.

### Resuming (already set up before)

Stopping both dev servers and Drizzle Studio (`Ctrl+C` in each terminal) does **not** touch the local D1 data — it's a real sqlite file on disk under `apps/api/.wrangler/state/`, not in-memory state, so it survives restarts and stays exactly as you left it.

To pick back up: just re-run `pnpm dev` (root) and, if you also want the DB inspector, `pnpm db:studio` in a second terminal. Do **not** re-run `pnpm db:migrate:local` unless you actually pulled new migration files (check `apps/api/migrations/` for new numbered files) — it's safe either way (migrations are tracked and idempotent), but there's no need to re-apply what's already applied.

Only wipe local data on purpose, if you ever want a truly clean slate: delete `apps/api/.wrangler/state/` and re-run `pnpm db:migrate:local`.

### Changing the schema

Edit `apps/api/src/db/schema.ts`, run `pnpm --filter api db:generate` (`drizzle-kit generate`, writes the next numbered migration into `apps/api/migrations/`), review the generated SQL, then `pnpm db:migrate:local` to apply it locally.

## Production Deployment

**One-time setup** (default domains, per ADR-0063/ADR-0064 — no custom domain purchase needed):

1. `wrangler d1 create exam-taker-db` (remote) and `wrangler kv namespace create CACHE` (remote); fill the real IDs into `apps/api/wrangler.jsonc` in place of the current placeholders.
2. `wrangler secret put JWT_SECRET` for the API Worker — never committed to code (ADR-0054).
3. `wrangler deploy` once to learn the API's real `*.workers.dev` URL (or set a custom Workers name in `wrangler.jsonc` to make it predictable ahead of time).
4. Create a Vercel project for `apps/web`, connected to the GitHub repo (monorepo root directory set to `apps/web`).
5. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://<worker-name>.<account>.workers.dev` as a Vercel environment variable.
6. Once the real `*.vercel.app` URL is known, add it to the API's CORS allow-list (`apps/api/src/index.ts`).
7. Create GitHub Actions secrets for CI/CD: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` (API deploy + migrations).

**Per-release steps (automated, ADR-0063):**

- **Every PR**: GitHub Actions runs lint, format check, and tests for both apps (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- **On merge to `main`**:
  - **API**: `.github/workflows/deploy-api.yml` runs `wrangler d1 migrations apply exam-taker-db --remote`, then `wrangler deploy` from `apps/api`.
  - **Frontend**: Vercel's own Git integration auto-builds and promotes `apps/web` to production — no GitHub Actions step needed for this half.

**Rollback:**

- Workers keep prior deployments — `wrangler rollback` reverts the API.
- Vercel keeps prior deployments too — redeploy or instantly roll back to any previous build from the dashboard.
- D1 migrations are forward-only. A bad migration is fixed with a new corrective migration, never a rollback of the migration file itself (`.claude/skills/d1-schema`).

## Where To Go Next

This doc describes the target shape. The actual scaffolding work (creating `package.json`s, the Drizzle schema, the Hono route skeleton, the Next.js app, shadcn init, OpenNext config) is Step 2 of `docs/build-plan.md` — not yet done. Step 2's exit criteria should be read as: everything in this doc's "Local Development" section works end to end.
